A long time ago, in a land far, far away... before death, before time...
===

There was a bow-legged dwarf named Ralph.

Or there wasn't.

He might have lived in a tranquil cavern in the side of a mountain with a name whose mention would make children hop with delight, but probably not.  He probably did none of those things.  He probably ate with the wrong hand and gave people dirty looks.  He probably ate unsanitary food from the floor, and communicated over long distances by yelling, if he did anything at all.

There was also a wizard.
There was definitely a wizard.

This wizard spent a lot of his time contemplating the possible existence of a hypothetical dwarf, who may or may not have existed.  Sometimes he just complained about unit testing.

KABOOM! Smoke filled the room. 

"Success?" questioned the wizard. 
A cough from across the room. "Hello?" said a small, confused voice, "who... am... is... what? O-M-G!"
The dwarf lives.
